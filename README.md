# Chirp
This React App is a GT themed Twitter Clone for the GT WebDev 2022 Fall Semester. You can view the website [here](https://18leij2.github.io/Chirp/).

## Project Setup
1. To set up the project on a Windows device, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) if not installed already.

2. Navigate to the desired local folder through the command line and clone the repository:
    ```shell
    $ git clone https://github.com/18leij2/Chirp.git
    ```
    > Alternatively, [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) may be used to clone the repository.

3. Navigate to the newly cloned `Chirp` directory through the command line:
    ```shell
    $ cd Chirp
    ```

4. Now, navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```shell
    $ cd frontend
    ```

5. In the same directory, call the following commands:
    ```shell
    $ npm install
    $ npm install react-twitter-embed
    ```

6. Finally, to run the React App, call the following command:
    ```shell
    $ npm start
    ```
    > This should automatically open a new tab in the default browser and display the Twitter Clone. 

From this point onwards, calling the `$ npm start` command anytime when in the `frontend` directory should display the React App. Any changes made to the source code will be reflected in the App for as long as the command is running. To terminate the command, hit `Ctrl+C` in the command prompt.
